## Works
### **Plant Pod** 2013.03
Human cannot communicate with plant. With the aid of IoT, the environment near a plant can be sensorable, able to sensor preferable environment for a plant. By displaying emoticon of the plant based on its environment, human can guess what the plant feels. With this instrument, he would like to induce communication with an unknownable object.

### **Live Camera** 2010.08
His laboratory had a CCTV for security reason. But to make its image more valuable, he opens its image to public by introducing rasterizing its image. He also created a web application to display time-series images in accordance with X-axis of mouse. Due to this system, student came to his laboratory more to communicate with other students.

### **Environmental Sensing** 2010.03
He developed a low-cost sensor module. He set the sensor modules into a real house, and created a system to upload data to cloud service. By reflecting this data into 3DCAD, residents and designer can confirm housing environment.
