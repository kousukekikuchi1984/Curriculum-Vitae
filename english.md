* Through the analytics experience, he learned programming of Ruby.
* From this experience, he worked as not only as an engineer but also as an analyst for business.
* He has strong experience of improving performance of Internet Advertising aside from implementation.

## Working Experience
### **Data Mining Engineer**, IPONWeb Japan - 2016.02-Present
* Planning of improving CPA performance of a DSP. He has improved 4 times more efficiency of Acquisition-based advertising.
* Rich experience on IT development made him manage projects of external data vendors and different divisions. Due to the new data, his service is able to improve performance by 20%.

### **Engineer**, Spotlight Inc., - 2014-04-2016.02
* He is a core member of developing server-side and of operating infra-side on "Rakuten Check" mobile application.
* He implemented two big functional additions, resulting in 50% increase of Active User.
* He also worked as a BizDev, culminating in 20-30% increase of conversions by fully-cooperation with Marketing devision.

### **Intern**, Hitachi Corporation Central Laboratory, - 2012.02-2012.04

## Academic Background
### **Waseda Edge Global Program for Development of Global Entrepreneurs**, Certificate 2016.12
* He learned a methodology of Lean Startup from Learning Entrepreneur's Lab.
* He tested his business hypotheses by interviewing our dream customers.

### **Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University**, ABD 2014.03
* He was a pioneer of Big Data Analytics on Urban Planning. He proposed and verified a methodology of characteristic of city by sensing and processing social media data.
* He developed an IoT environmental sensoring module, and visualized its environmental infomation into 3DCAD.

### **Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University**, Master of Architecture 2009.03
* He proposed a design guideline of elderly housing to increase health lifespan as long as possible. Current design guideline insists that most housing functions should be achieved within same story to avoid risk. But for younger dweller this guideline will decrease change of activity. By introducing simple renovation plan, he confirmed the guideline was good in early and late life stage.
* He proposed a mathematical model of distributing customers at cummercial complex, and verified it with a large-scale follow-up servey. He also consulted a design of a department store with this model.

## Works
### **Plant Pod** 2013.03
Human cannot communicate with plant. With the aid of IoT, the environment near a plant can be sensorable, able to sensor preferable environment for a plant. By displaying emoticon of the plant based on its environment, human can guess what the plant feels. With this instrument, he would like to induce communication with an unknownable object.

### **Live Camera** 2010.08
His laboratory had a CCTV for security reason. But to make its image more valuable, he opens its image to public by introducing rasterizing its image. He also created a web application to display time-series images in accordance with X-axis of mouse. Due to this system, student came to his laboratory more to communicate with other students.

### **Environmental Sensing** 2010.03
He developed a low-cost sensor module. He set the sensor modules into a real house, and created a system to upload data to cloud service. By reflecting this data into 3DCAD, residents and designer can confirm housing environment.
